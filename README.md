# Advanced-Programming-ex 1

to compile and run do the following:
...

the two input vectors first undergo a series of input checks, in order to make sure they are a valid input that we can perform calculations on. all the relevant test are in input_check.cpp file.
the test are....
1.
2.
3....

once we assure the two vectors are valid, we send them to the different distance functions, as requested in the exercise instructions.
the distance functions are computed in the distanceFunctions.cpp file.
we compute Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Canberra and Minkowski distance, as requested.

the distance functions use different operations such as absolute value, sum, square root and others, that we created in the helperFunctions.cpp file...
